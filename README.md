# odin-recipes
First project for TOP. This will be a kind of recipe website. This project covers the use of a boilerplate, using headings and paragraphs, links, and photos. I will also be using Git extensively for this project and will get used to staging and committing changes to this project. My first commit will actually be for this text file.
