    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>Boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Your choice of oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>Chilli powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol><li>Generously season the chicken with all the seasonings listed above. For each seasoning, you will season until you hear the ancestors telling you to stop. However, you only need to use a pinch of the chilli powder. The seasoning you'll want to use the most of to give the chicken it's distinct flavour is the smoked paprika.</li>
<li>Once both sides of the chicken are coated in the seasonings, you are going to spray or brush your air fryer tray with oil. To save on cleanup time, place a sheet of parchment paper in the air fryer and then coat that with oil instead of the tray itself.</li>
<li> Cook the chicken at 400 degrees F for 28 minutes. Cooking time may vary depending on your air fryer and how much chicken you are cooking at once. Halfway through the cook time, flip the chicken to ensure it cooks evenly and both sides end up nice and crispy.</li>
<li> Serve as you wish. Goes great with rice and beans. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
