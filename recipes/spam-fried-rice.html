    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A recipe by Jarod St Pierre. A classic asian dish with a maple syrup gringo twist. </p>
    <p>This dish is a great way to use up any leftovers, refresh them, and make them taste fantastic! This is one of Dina's favourites. It is also a pretty simple dish to make.If you don't have spam, you can use pretty much any other cooked meat. I've made this same recipe with chicken before and it's still delicious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>Spam</li>
        <li>Day old white rice</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>Chicken Stock powder</li>
        <li>Your choice of veggies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol><li>Put some olive oil in a large pan and set it on the stove on medium-high heat. While waiting for the pan to heat up, dice your spam. Once it's hot, add in some minced garlic and cook it until it's translucent.</li>
    <li>Start frying your spam. You can cook it however much you like. I personally like it when the outside is a touch crispy but its still soft on the inside.</li>
    <li>Once your spam is cooked to your liking, you are pretty much just gonna throw in all the other ingredients and spices. Don't be shy about. For the spices, simply listen to the ancestors and taste frequently. This is very much a freestyle kind of dish. Keep stirring the rice ocassionally and cook until you're satisfied. I personally love it when there is a crispy layer to the rice but it's still soft and flavourful. Enjoy! Once you master the basics of making fried rice, you can start adding your own twist to it. It is such a fun and versatile dish!</li>
